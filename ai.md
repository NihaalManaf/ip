Used Cursor to rewrite the read.me file
- Readme didn't require a proper write up yet so I used cursor to create a 
temporary one which talks about my bot, Optimus prime.

Used Cursor to fix all checkstyle errors that failed checkStyleMain
- There were over 100 mistakes that needed to be corrected.
- Cursor was able to solve all but 2 of them
- Errors consisted of spacing issues between '{}' brackets or between variables, ordering of imports etc.
